According to the **2019 Global Burden of Disease study**, **Migraine is the 2nd most common neurological disorder** and the **3rd leading cause of morbidity** among these conditions, and yet, **only around 40% of those with episodic migraine and 10% of those with chronic migraine receive a professional diagnosis**. To address this, **multiple screening measures were developed to aid case identification in primary healthcare settings**. However, **important gaps are still present** as **no previous study was conducted to assess the performance of the Migraine-4 and MS-Q tools in the same sample**, or whether **the choice of assessment tools affects measured differences in quality of life between migraineurs and non-migraineurs**. **This study was conducted to address both of these gaps.**

In this study, we showed that **the Migraine-4 tool performed similarly to the MS-Q**, while being **one item shorter**. The **ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria** were able to **identify individuals with a lower physical quality of life**, possibly by selecting those who are **more affected by migraines due to their specific site, character, severity, or relations to exercise**, all of which are **not measured by screening tools**. The diagnostic criteria include **three extra items** and can be **self-administered**; as a result, **we recommended its use for migraine assessment in primary care settings**. **We believe that these findings offer a significant contribution to the field and would be of interest to the readers of your journal.**
